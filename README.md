The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors

1st Iteration
Tasked with creation a rock, paper , scissors game using html and javascript, that is playable in the browser console.
Each round played against the computer, and the best out of 5 wins.

I wrote the round code the absolute shortest way I could think to. It was probably not the most optimal way. I might need to be more specific.

Getting my player and computer selections to convert to lowercase was/ is a struggle. Everytime I put it in there it seems to break something.
