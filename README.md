The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors

1st Iteration
Tasked with creation a rock, paper , scissors game using html and javascript, that is playable in the browser console.
Each round played against the computer, and the best out of 5 wins.

I wrote the round code the absolute shortest way I could think to. It was probably not the most optimal way. I might need to be more specific.

This definitely helped reinforce the problem solving and understanding errors lessons that preceded this project. There were a lot of little errors i made along the way. I honestly think I made an example of almost every mistake covered in those lessons.

It was very fun though and I can't wait to expand on this project in the future.
